### Project Summary: World Layoffs Analysis

**Objective**: To analyze global layoff trends from mid-2023 to mid-2024, focusing on companies, industries, and countries most impacted, as well as year-over-year changes.

**Approach**:  
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and standardized layoff data from Kaggle, addressing duplicates, null values, and formatting issues.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Conducted SQL-based analysis to uncover trends in layoffs by company, industry, country, and time. Used functions like `DENSE_RANK` and rolling totals to derive insights.

**Tools Used**:  
- **SQL (MySQL)** for data cleaning and analysis.  
- **Kaggle** as the dataset source.

**Key Insights**:  
- **Highest Layoffs**: Intel led in 2024, while VMware topped 2023.  
- **Industry & Country Impact**: Transportation saw the most layoffs, with the U.S. consistently leading globally.  
- **Yearly Trends**: Layoffs peaked in 2024, with clear monthly fluctuations.

The project achieved its goal of providing a detailed analysis of global layoff patterns, highlighting critical insights for businesses and policymakers.
